# Expo Template With Typescript, React Router & NativeBase

An alternative template to the default expo-template using more popular libraries for faster development:

- `react-router` instead of react-navigation, with utils for ease of usage
- `NativeBase` as the base of all ui components including wrappers to handle Paragraphs and Tables easier and consistently
- `AsyncStorage` with a custom hook to allow easy state management of persisted data

Also included:
- `yarn berry` for more modern dependency managment
- `eslint and prettier and madge` pre-configured with recommended standards
- `jest` for unit testing

## Pre-requisites

You should be running Node >=16 and yarn >=3

## Usage

Start a new expo project referencing this template:

```
expo init --template expo-template-reactrouter-nativebase
```
